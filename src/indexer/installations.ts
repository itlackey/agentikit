 * `deriveInstallations` — akm 0.9.0 Chunk 5, milestone M-a.
 *
 * Bridges the `SearchSource[]` model (the live indexer's source list,
 * `search-source.ts`) onto the durable `BundleInstallation[]` /
 * `BundleComponent[]` model (spec §1.1). LIVE: called from the indexer
 * (provenance derivation), the proposal repository, and written-asset
 * indexing. The originally-planned full "Step-3" `scanComponent`-driven scan
 * swap was superseded by the narrower Chunk-5 F4a drain-dir engine swap; the
 * shadow-parity scaffolding module (`scan/scan-installations.ts`) was deleted
 * as dead in the 0.9.0 close-out.
 *
 * Per source → one installation:
 *   - `id`       = `source.registryId` ?? a deterministic slug of `source.path`
 *                  (the `<bundle>` prefix of every ref this installation emits,
 *                  spec §1.3). Slugs are made unique WITHIN a derivation batch
 *                  by appending a short path-hash suffix on collision, so two
 *                  sources sharing a basename never mint the same bundle id.
 *   - `trusted`  = `source.writable === true`. 0.9.0 ships no first-class trust
 *                  record (spec §1.3 — "no new trust machinery"); the writable
 *                  primary/config stashes are the user's own and count as
 *                  trusted, read-only registry caches do not. Nothing consumes
 *                  `trusted` in the live path yet (installation grants nothing,
 *                  History D8) — this is the Tier-A placeholder mapping.
 *   - components = ONE component for the current single-root akm layout
 *                  (spec §1.2 rule 5): `{ id, root: source.path, adapter }`. The
 *                  akm layout's type dirs (`knowledge/`, `skills/`, …) are NOT
 *                  separate components — they are type-derived leading path
 *                  segments of the conceptId within the one component.
 *
 * ── The component id == the bundle id (transitional coupling) ──
 *
 * The `akm` adapter's `recognize` derives an item's ref prefix from the
 * component it is handed (`ref = ${c.id}//${conceptId}`, `akm-adapter.ts`), so
 * for the single-component akm layout the component id MUST equal the
 * installation/bundle id for refs to be `bundle//conceptId`. This mirrors the
 * `akm-adapter.test.ts` convention (`component({ id: BUNDLE_ID })`). Splitting
 * component-provenance from the bundle prefix (recognize learning the bundle
 * from the installation) is a downstream contract refinement — nothing in the
 * live path reads `IndexDocument.component` as distinct from `bundle` today.
 *
 * ── Adapter selection (spec §1.2 ordered probe) ──
 *
 * The adapter is chosen by the ordered `looksLikeRoot` probe over the built-in
 * adapters (`getAdapters()`), first match wins. The registry is now a STATIC
 * FROZEN map (normative §12.6) populated at module load, so this probe runs in
 * production with the full 11-family set — no registration call is required
 * first. Array order (`BUILTIN_ADAPTERS`) is the probe precedence, most-specific
 * first, so a `.claude`/dotenv/wiki root is claimed by its tight probe before
 * the loose `akm` stash-shape probe.
 *
 * When NO adapter's probe fires (an empty or not-yet-materialized root), the
 * fallback is **`akm`** (see {@link FALLBACK_ADAPTER_ID}), preserving workspace
 * root behavior. Explicit configured ownership always wins over probing.

 *    depends on either explicit adapter configuration, `akm.looksLikeRoot`
 *    firing (type dirs / `.stash` present), or this fallback. A genuinely empty
 *    root fires no probe; `akm` keeps the implicit workspace root correct.
 *  - Status quo: before the registry was wired, `getAdapters()` was empty in
