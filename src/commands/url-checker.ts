 * examined at most twenty links in a bundle holding thousands and reported
 * success. Both are gone. It checks what you asked it to check, at a bounded
 * concurrency (see {@link URL_CHECK_CONCURRENCY}) so a large bundle does not
 * turn into a request flood, and each request is bounded by
 * {@link DEAD_URL_TIMEOUT_MS} so one unresponsive host cannot stall the rest.
 *
 * A `>=400` response or a timeout surfaces as a `DeadUrl` (a timeout as
 * `status: "timeout"`) rather than being swallowed, so a network problem is
 * visible instead of looking like a clean bill of health. A DNS/connection
 * failure (see {@link NETWORK_ERROR_CODES}) is different: it says the check
 * itself could not run, not that the URL is dead, so it is counted in
 * `coverage.skipped` instead of either `deadUrls` or a silent success. Any
 * other thrown error still reports as `status: "error"`. `coverage.checked`
 * and `coverage.total` are equal only when nothing was skipped this way.
