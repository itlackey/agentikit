/**
 * `type-directory-disagreement` advisory for `akm health` (#831).
 *
 * The invariant "a file's directory declares its type" is load-bearing for
 * refs, namespace listings, and `akm show` paths (see #824: three files
 * written to `memories/` were indexed as `type: command`, moved their refs
 * under `commands/memories/<slug>`, and silently vanished from the
 * `memories/` namespace — nothing on any normal surface said so). This
 * advisory re-checks that invariant against every currently indexed entry.
 *
 * Legitimate disagreements exist by design — a `knowledge/` file containing
 * `$ARGUMENTS` is deliberately a `command`, and an `agents/` file with an
 * `agent:` frontmatter key is deliberately a `command` (both asserted in
 * `tests/integration/commands/show.test.ts`). So this is never a hard
 * failure: every disagreement is reported with a `winner` naming which
 * classifier signal produced the resolved type, so a deliberate override
 * reads differently from an unexplained one.
