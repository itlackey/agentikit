/**
 * Tell "this path is not there" apart from "I am not allowed to look at it"
 * (issue #791).
 *
 * # Why this exists
 *
 * `fs.existsSync()` answers `false` for BOTH cases: it swallows every error,
 * so `ENOENT` (genuinely absent) and `EACCES` (present, unreadable) are
 * indistinguishable. akm used `existsSync` as its "is there an index?" gate on
 * the read path, so an index the caller could not read was reported as an index
 * that did not exist — `akm search` and `akm curate` returned
 * `hits: []` with the tip *"No search index available. Run 'akm index' to build
 * one."* at exit 0, for a populated index sitting right there on disk.
 *
 * That is the worst possible shape for a failure. A non-zero exit is a problem
 * the operator can see; an empty-but-successful result is a lie that a
 * consuming agent will confidently relay to its user. In the report that
 * prompted this module, exactly that happened: an agent told its user akm's
 * "vector service is unavailable and its maintenance lock is read-only" — a
 * story it invented to explain results that claimed to be fine.
 *
 * # Contract
 *
 * `absent` means the path (or a parent component) genuinely is not there, which
 * is a legitimate first-run state every caller already handles. `inaccessible`
 * means the path may well exist and this process cannot determine that or read
 * it — a caller must NEVER degrade that to an empty-but-successful result.

 * else that fails is `inaccessible`, carrying its errno: a permission error is
 * the common case, but a symlink loop or an I/O error are equally "present as
 * far as anyone knows, and unusable", and silently treating them as "no index"
 * is the bug this module exists to prevent.
 *
 * Statting is not enough — a file can be `stat`-able through a searchable
 * parent while being unreadable itself — so a successful stat is confirmed with
 * an `R_OK` access check.
