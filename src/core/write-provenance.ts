/**
 * Run-scoped write provenance (#652).
 *
 * # Why this exists
 *
 * `akm improve`'s end-of-run auto-sync used to infer "what did this run write?"
 * by diffing two Git dirty-path snapshots: everything dirty at end-of-run minus
 * everything dirty when the run acquired its lock. That inference is wrong in
 * both directions:
 *
 *   - an unrelated managed-dir edit made by a human DURING a long run appears in
 *     the end-of-run diff and gets swept into akm's commit;
 *   - a path that was ALREADY dirty when the run started and is then rewritten by
 *     the run is subtracted out and never committed.
 *
 * The journal below replaces the inference with a record. Every akm write path
 * that mutates a file on disk calls {@link recordWrittenPath}; a run opens a
 * journal for its duration and reads back the exact set of paths it touched.
 *
 * # Contract
 *
 *   - A *write* and a *removal* are recorded identically — the journal records
 *     "this run mutated this path", not what the mutation was. The final on-disk
 *     state is what gets staged (`git add -A -- <path>` stages a deletion just as
 *     happily as a modification), so a path written and then reverted, purged, or
 *     rolled back needs no special handling: it is journaled once and the stager
 *     sees whatever survived.
 *   - Recording is a no-op when no journal is open, so non-improve command paths
 *     pay nothing but a `Set.size` check.
 *   - Journals nest: every open journal observes every recorded path. Concurrent
 *     in-process runs (tests) therefore over-report rather than cross-attribute
 *     writes to the wrong run, which is the safe direction — over-reporting stages
 *     a path that has no diff, under-reporting loses a write.
 *   - Nothing here throws. A provenance failure must never break a write.
