/**
 * Tool-dir-shaped adapters (#908): their install-time probe recognizes only a
 * BOUNDED slice of the root — `claude`/`opencode`'s own `commands`/`agents`/
 * `skills` tool dirs, or `agent-skills`' own `<name>/SKILL.md` packages. A
 * bundle that ALSO carries ordinary akm content (`knowledge/`, `workflows/`,
 * a stray `content/` folder of Markdown, …) alongside one of these layouts had
 * that content SILENTLY dropped: the narrow adapter won the ordered probe and
 * indexed only its own three-dir slice, with no warning that anything else
 * was there (issue #908 — 73 documents disappeared from one real bundle).
 *
 * `okf` / `llm-wiki` / `dotenv` / `website-snapshot` / `akm-workflow` /
 * `akm-task` are deliberately NOT in this set: each carries its own tight,
 * disjoint marker (a root `index.md`, `schema.md`+`pages/`, an env/secrets-only
 * layout, `manifest.json`, a workflow/task-shaped top-level file) that is not
 * at risk of firing merely because a FEW directory names happen to overlap
 * with akm's own stash subdirs — narrowing the fix to the three families the
 * issue is actually about keeps this from touching adapters it was never
 * about.

 * that `winnerId` does not own (its `directoryList()`, or — for `agent-skills`,
 * which owns no fixed directory names — a root-level `<name>/SKILL.md`
 * package) but which holds at least one real file. Cheap by design: only
 * shallow `readdirSync` calls, one level into each candidate top-level dir —
 * no recursive walk, no file content read, no git spawn — so this never adds
