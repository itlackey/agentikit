// Output shape registration for `akm propose` (#226).
// Shares the proposal-producer envelope shape (success carries a proposal
// entry; failure carries an AgentFailureReason discriminant) with the
// internal `akmReflect` result shape — but `reflect` has no standalone CLI
// verb and never reaches the output() chokepoint (reflect.ts is called
// directly by the improve loop, not through this registry), so only
// `propose` is registered here.
//
// Deliberately phrased WITHOUT the literal call spelling: the registry
// completeness scanner (tests/integration/output-shape-registry-completeness.ts)
// greps sources for that exact pattern to find commands needing a shape, and
// it does not skip comments — so writing the spelling here to explain the
// absence would re-summon the very registration this comment says is gone.
