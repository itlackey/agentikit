/**
 * SourceProvider — minimal interface.
 *
 * A SourceProvider gets files into a directory. The indexer walks `path()` and
 * reads files from disk; search and show go through the indexer, not through
 * provider methods.
 *
 *   - name      configured source name
 *   - kind      "filesystem" | "git" | "website" | "npm"
 *   - path()    the directory the indexer walks (stable for instance lifetime)
 *   - sync?()   refresh the directory from upstream (no-op for filesystem)
 *
 * All other writing/reading concerns live outside this interface:
 *   - Writes:    src/core/write-source.ts
 *   - Reads:     src/indexer/indexer.ts
 *   - Install:   src/sources/providers/sync-from-ref.ts
 */

/**
 * Resolves a secret-store ref (e.g. `secrets/x-bearer-token`) to its value, or
 * null when absent.
 *
 * This is a leaf abstraction on purpose. The concrete store reader
 * (`core/env-secret-ref.ts`) transitively imports the source providers, which
 * import the fetcher registry — so any module inside that subgraph that
 * imported the reader directly would close the import cycle the ratchet
 * forbids. Consumers (fetchers, provider `sync()`) depend on this interface;
 * the concrete binding is INJECTED from a composition root above the cycle
 * (see `snapshot-fetchers/secret-seam.ts` and `indexer/indexer.ts`). Keeping
 * the type here — in a module that is a sink of the import graph (it imports
 * only type-only `config` and `./types`) — means `search-source`/`website`
 * can name the type without creating a runtime back-edge.
 *
 * Implementations must never log or otherwise surface the resolved value.
