/**
 * Reads a secret out of akm's secret store for the fetcher `resolveSecret`
 * seam (see `FetcherContext.resolveSecret`).
 *
 * This module — NOT the fetchers themselves — is what imports
 * `core/env-secret-ref`. That module transitively imports the source
 * providers, which import the fetcher registry, so a fetcher importing it
 * directly would close an import cycle. Keeping the dependency here lets the
 * fetchers stay leaves while still reaching the store.
 *
 * Returns null for any failure — missing store, unresolvable ref, unreadable
 * file. The underlying error is deliberately not surfaced: it can embed
 * filesystem paths, and every failure means the same thing to a caller ("no
 * secret"). The value itself is never logged.
