/**
 * Decide which exact values must be scrubbed from a task's persisted run log
 * (issue #755).
 *
 * # The gap
 *
 * All three task target kinds funnel through `persistRunLog`, which applied
 * only `redactCredentialPatterns` — credential *shapes* (`Bearer …`, `sk-…`,
 * webhook URLs). Prompt- and workflow-target runs additionally redact the exact
 * secret values reachable by the run before their output ever reaches the log.
 * Command-target runs did not: a scheduled command that echoed a configured
 * secret whose value is not credential-shaped persisted it verbatim, into both
 * the `.log` file and `logs.db`, for the whole retention window.
 *
 * # Why the obvious fix is wrong
 *
 * The issue proposed reusing {@link isEnvPassthroughValueSafeToExpose} — the
 * filter the prompt path uses — over the env handed to the child. That filter
 * fails CLOSED for any name outside a 22-entry allowlist, which is right where
 * it currently runs: the prompt path filters `envPassthrough`, a short list the
 * operator explicitly declared. A command task inherits the WHOLE ambient
 * environment, so the same rule classifies essentially everything as secret.
 * Measured on a developer machine: 127 of 132 variables, 25 of them with
 * one-character values (`SHLVL=1`, `OLDPWD=/`, `GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0`).
 * Redaction is substring replacement, so those become live needles:
 *
 *     Build finished in 12.4s        ->  Build finished in [REDACTED]2.[REDACTED]s
 *     3 tests passed, 0 failed       ->  [REDACTED] tests passed, [REDACTED] failed
 *     wrote dist/index.js (48 KB)    ->  wrote dist[REDACTED]index.js ([REDACTED]8 KB)
 *
 * A fix that destroys every command log is not a fix.
 *
 * # What this does instead
 *
 * Three sources, and the distinction between them is the whole design:
 *
 *  1. **Declared by config** — the config names which variables hold
 *     credentials (`engines.<n>.apiKey: ${VAR}`, `embedding.apiKey`, and the
 *     implicit `AKM_ENGINE_<NAME>_API_KEY` / `AKM_LLM_API_KEY` /
 *     `AKM_EMBED_API_KEY` recipes). akm KNOWS these are secret.
 *  2. **Declared by the task** — the `redact:` list, names only.
 *  3. **Inferred** — a name-shape heuristic over the remaining environment, for
 *     the ambient credential akm was never told about.
 *
 * Only (3) is a guess, so only (3) carries {@link MIN_INFERRED_SECRET_LENGTH}.
 * A declared secret is redacted at ANY length, because the operator told us
 * what it is; applying a floor to declared values would silently stop redacting
 * short secrets that are scrubbed today. The floor exists solely to stop a
 * *guess* from mangling a log, and 8 clears every real credential format (AWS
 * key id 20, GitHub PAT 40, `sk-…` 40+) while excluding the flags and counters
 * that a name heuristic occasionally catches.
 *
 * Note what is deliberately NOT collected: the akm secret store on disk. A
 * spawned command sees `process.env`, not akm's stores — a stored secret can
 * only be echoed if it is already in the environment, where the rules above
 * catch it by name. Walking every bundle's `secrets/` on each task firing would
 * cost a recursive readdir plus an unbounded read for values the child cannot
 * reach anyway. `redact:` is the escape hatch for a secret injected under a
 * name none of the rules recognise.

 * `/`, `80`, `true`, `xhigh`, `31999`); at 8 a chance collision with ordinary
