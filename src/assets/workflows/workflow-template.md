# {{TITLE}}

Free preamble prose describing what this workflow does. It is indexed for
search and shown in `akm show`, but it is never dispatched to a step.

## first-step

Describe what to do in this step. Refer to run parameters in plain
language — for example, "read the value given by the `example_param`
parameter" — never as a template expression like `{{ example_param }}`.

## second-step

Describe what happens next, using the first step's artifact — attached to
this unit as context because this step declares
`inputs: [steps.first-step.output]` above — referred to in prose as "the
first step's attached artifact."

### gate

A `### gate` sub-heading is the step's completion rubric: the judge
receives this whole section byte-exact. Omit the heading or leave its text
empty to skip validation. A non-empty rubric requires
`workflow.judgeEngine`; verifier failures and malformed verdicts reject the
gate rather than silently skipping it.

- Confirm the step accomplished what it set out to do.
- Confirm nothing required was silently skipped.
