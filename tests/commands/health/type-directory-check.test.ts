/**
 * #831: the `type-directory-disagreement` health advisory must flag every
 * indexed asset whose resolved type disagrees with the type its directory
 * declares, while naming which classifier signal won so a deliberate
 * override (the two contracts asserted in
 * tests/integration/commands/show.test.ts) reads differently from an
 * unexplained one. Never a hard failure — always `status: "warn"`, never
 * `"fail"`.
