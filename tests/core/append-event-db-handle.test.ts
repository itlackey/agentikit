/**
 * `appendEvent`'s best-effort contract, for the caller that brings its own
 * connection (`ctx.db` — the `akmImprove` shape).
 *
 * Two properties are pinned here, both invisible to the callers that let
 * `appendEvent` open state.db for them:
 *   • `dbPath` is IGNORED when `db` is provided — resolution never runs, so an
 *     environment that cannot name a data dir is not an error for a caller
 *     already holding an open handle.
 *   • the event still lands on that handle.
