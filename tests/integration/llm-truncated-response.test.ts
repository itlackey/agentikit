/**
 * Truncated LLM responses (`finishReason: "length"`), issue #865.
 *
 * `#815`/`#816` fixed the CAUSE in normal operation (`reasoningEffort` is now
 * a first-class field, so the token-budget truncation that cost ~50% of
 * reflect calls no longer routinely happens). The HANDLING stayed untested:
 * when a response IS truncated mid-JSON, `chatCompletion` resolves
 * successfully (a 200 with valid envelope JSON is not a transport error) and
 * returns only the raw content string — `finishReason` is computed for
 * telemetry (`emitLlmUsage`) but never reaches the caller. `runStructured`
 * (src/core/structured.ts), which every structured-output call site sits on,
 * then fails to parse the truncated JSON and reports the same generic
 * `parse_error` it would for garbled or empty model output — there is no
 * channel for "the model was still writing when the token cap cut it off" to
 * reach that classification at all.
 *
 * This test pins that current behavior. See the accompanying report for the
 * judgment call on whether `finishReason: "length"` should get a distinct
 * classification (decision: no — see PR/issue notes).
