/**
 * `akm lint --fix` mutation safety (issue #761).
 *
 * Two gaps, both about a write nobody could see:
 *
 *   1. NO WRITABLE CHECK. Every other mutating command routes through
 *      `core/write-source.ts`'s `ensureWritable`; `--fix` wrote directly and
 *      never consulted the flag, so it happily rewrote frontmatter in a bundle
 *      configured `writable: false`.
 *   2. NO TRANSACTIONAL CONTRACT. A single file's fix-write throwing
 *      (`base-linter.ts`'s `fs.writeFileSync`) escaped `akmLint()` entirely.
 *      The caller got an exception instead of a result — and files fixed
 *      EARLIER in the same sweep stayed mutated on disk with nothing reporting
 *      that they had.
 *
 * Both are pinned here against the real `akmLint()` entry point.
