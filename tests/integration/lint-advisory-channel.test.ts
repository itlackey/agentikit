/**
 * The lint advisory channel and the workflow frontend pass behind it.
 *
 * Three properties, all about routing a NON-FATAL finding correctly:
 *   • `ADVISORY_LINT_ISSUES` is the single home for "never `flagged`", so no
 *     two routing points can disagree about a code and let a non-fatal hint
 *     fail `--fail-on-flagged` (exit 1) on one path only.
 *   • `workflowFrontendDiagnostics` is ONE parse+compile carrying both halves,
 *     so the sweep runs the frontend exactly once per workflow file — the
 *     property a pair of single-view helpers could only hold by accident, when
 *     their two call sites happened to sit next to each other.
 *   • the sweep files each finding by the classifier, never by which half of
 *     the pass produced it.
