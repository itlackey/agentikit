/**
 * Real on-disk corruption of `index.db` (issue #865).
 *
 * Only narrow in-column JSON corruption (a bad `document_json` value inside an
 * otherwise-healthy database) had coverage before this file — nothing garbled
 * actual SQLite page bytes on disk to prove the driver's `SQLITE_CORRUPT`
 * report is handled rather than either crashing the CLI or silently serving an
 * empty index (indistinguishable from "found nothing").
 *
 * `index.db` is documented (src/core/state-db.ts, "Why a separate database
 * from index.db") as fully regenerable from the stash on disk, so a corrupt
 * index is recovered by deleting it and rebuilding — but nothing actually did
 * that delete before this fix (see `openIndexDatabase` in
 * src/storage/repositories/index-connection.ts): a garbled file made every
 * open throw `SQLITE_CORRUPT`, including the rebuild attempt itself, so the
 * final failure reached the user as a raw internal error.
