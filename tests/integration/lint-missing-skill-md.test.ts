/**
 * `missing-skill-md` is reachable again (issue #774).
 *
 * Two halves of the same gap:
 *
 *   1. `agent-skills` `validate()` iterated CHANGES, and a change is always a
 *      FILE — so a package directory carrying resources but no `SKILL.md`
 *      contributed nothing the loop could see. The code's own comment deferred
 *      the case to `directorySkillDiagnostics`, a symbol that did not exist.
 *      The check is now a real directory pass over `ValidateContext.list`.
 * Both are driven through the real `akm lint` entry point, plus a direct
 * `validate()` call for the containment rules the CLI cannot express.
