/**
 * #831 end-to-end: `akm health` must flag any REAL indexed asset whose
 * resolved type disagrees with the type its directory declares, using the
 * actual indexer/index.db, not synthetic entries. It must:
 *   - stay silent when the indexed stash agrees with its directories,
 *   - name the correct classifier + "known-good override" for the two
 *     deliberate-override contracts asserted in
 *     tests/integration/commands/show.test.ts, and
 *   - flag the #824 defect shape (an entry's indexed type disagreeing with
 *     its directory) as an unexplained ("unknown") disagreement, and never
 *     as a hard failure.
 *
 * #826 already fixed the numeric-placeholder regex, so the defect shape can
 * no longer be reproduced by writing a body that trips it — the corrupted
 * row is constructed directly against index.db instead, mirroring how #824
 * actually manifested: a correctly-placed file whose indexed `type` ended up
 * wrong.
