/**
 * Real-subprocess coverage for the shared fixture-stash loader's DEFAULT
 * (non-`skipIndex`) behaviour.
 *
 * ISOLATION-06 / RUNTIME-04: `loadFixtureStash(name)` without
 * `{ skipIndex: true }` runs a real `akm index` CLI subprocess
 * (tests/fixtures/stashes/load.ts:135-148, `Bun.spawnSync`). A stalled
 * synchronous spawn blocks the whole JS runtime past every JS-level test
 * timeout (see scripts/lint-tests-isolation.ts Rule 5), so this test —
 * the ONLY call site anywhere in the repo that exercises the default,
 * spawning path — lives in tests/integration/ rather than alongside its
 * sibling smoke tests in tests/fixture-stash-loader.test.ts (unit scope).
 * Moved here (behaviour unchanged) so the unit target never spawns.
 *
 * #786 ORG-04: relocated out of tests/integration/fixtures/stashes/ — no
 * .test.ts belongs under a fixtures/_fixtures path.
 *
 * The literal sentinel-value AKM_BUNDLE_DIR override this test needs (to
 * prove `loadFixtureStash`'s cleanup restores to whatever was set before the
 * call, not some hardcoded default) is routed through `withEnv` rather than
 * a raw `process.env.AKM_BUNDLE_DIR = …` assignment, so this file needs no
 * isolation-lint allowlist entry.
